# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES


## Pull-requests

- Pull-request must be properly submitted
    - Intelligible description of the PR: description of the **issue solved**, or the **feature added**
	- one PR = one logical modification (one fix or one new feature)
- Commit must build **successfully** on Jenkins for all platforms (compilation + tests + examples)
- **Examples** (at least one) must be provided showing the new feature
	- examples/Components
- **Test** required for each new component or if an issue is fixed
    - SofaTest
    - in myplugin/myplugin_test
    - possibly for each template e.g. Vec3d, Rigid3d ?
- Code must be **documented** in a Doxygen compliant way and in english
    - global presentation in header
    - description of each function and parameter/Data


## General rules

### Base rules
The base rules are Google C++ Style Guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html   
All rules below **replace** the corresponding base rules.  
For any subject not mentionned below, please refer to the base.

### Naming
Identifiers must respect the following conventions

- Class names are in UpperCamelCase
- Function names are in lowerCamelCase()
- Namespaces names are in lowercase
- Variables names are in lowerCamelCase and must express their use more than their type.  
Exceptions:  mathematical objects like `Matrix M`, local iterators variables like `i`, `j`, `k`  and usual symbols like `x` for positions or `v` for velocities.
- Data member variables names must begin with `d_`
- Link member variables names (e.g. SingleLink) must begin with `l_`
- Other member variables names must begin with `m_ `(exception: this is not mandatory for PODs as well as public attributes)
- Names for booleans variables must answer a question: `m_isRed`, `m_hasName`
- C++ files must must have the extension .h, .cpp, or .inl
- Files that define a class should have the same name as the class and should contain only one class.
- Each library name should be prefixed with `Sofa`.

### Formatting
- Special characters like TAB and page break must be avoided.
- Indentation must use **4 spaces** everywhere (C++ and Python), but there must be no indentation for namespaces
- Braces use the **Allman style**: the opening brace associated with a control statement is on the next line, indented to the same level as the control statement, and statements within the braces are indented to the next level.
    ```cpp
    while (x == y)
    {
        something();
        somethingElse();
    }
    finalThing();
    ```
- A space character should be used in the following situations:
    - After C++ reserved words: `if (true)`
    - Around binary operators: `a + b`
    - After commas: `doSomething(a, b, c)`
    - After semicolons in for statements: `for (unsigned int i = 0; i < container.size(); i++)`
    ```cpp
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < container.size(); ++i )
    {
        if ((a + b) > c)
        {
            doSomething(a, b, c);
        }
    }
    ```

- Template declarations are split on two lines
    ```cpp
    template<class T>
    static void dynamicCast(T*& ptr, Base* b);
    ```

### Coding
- You should try to use as few `#include` directive as possible.
- You should limit as much as possible the amount of code in included files (*.h, *.inl).
- All definitions should reside in source files. The header files should declare an interface only.
- Variables should be initialized when they are declared.
- You should use `const` profusely.
- You should use `assert` profusely.
- You must avoid the `using` directive in header files (.h and .inl): ~~`using namespace foo;`~~
- You should declare automatic variables only when you need them (not before).
- You must always initialize pointers, either to the address of something, or to `NULL`

### Commenting
Code must be commented in a Doxygen compliant way.  
Most used commands are `///` or `/**` before blocks and `///<` after member declarations.  
Please DO NOT use `//` or `///` after member declarations.  
Example  
```cpp
/**
 * @brief MechanicalObject class
 */
template <class DataTypes>
class MechanicalObject : public sofa::core::behavior::MechanicalState<DataTypes>
{
    Data< bool >  showObject; ///< Show objects. (default=false)
    Data< float > showObjectScale; ///< Scale for object display. (default=0.1)
    Data< float > showVectorsScale; ///< Scale for vectors display. (default=0.0001)
    Data< defaulttype::Vec4f > d_color;  ///< drawing color
    Data< bool > isToPrint; ///< ignore some Data for file export

    /// @name New vectors access API based on VecId
    /// @{
    virtual Data< VecCoord >* write(core::VecCoordId v);
    virtual const Data< VecCoord >* read(core::ConstVecCoordId v) const;

    virtual Data< VecDeriv >* write(core::VecDerivId v);
    virtual const Data< VecDeriv >* read(core::ConstVecDerivId v) const;
    /// @}

    /** \brief Reorder values according to parameter.
     *
     * Result of this method is :
     * newValue[ i ] = oldValue[ index[i] ];
     */
    void renumberValues( const sofa::helper::vector<unsigned int> &index );

    /** \brief Replace the value at index by the sum of the ancestors values weithed by the coefs.
     *
     * Sum of the coefs should usually equal to 1.0
     */
    void computeWeightedValue( const unsigned int i, const sofa::helper::vector< unsigned int >& ancestors, const sofa::helper::vector< double >& coefs);

    /// Force the position of a point (and force its velocity to zero value)
    void forcePointPosition( const unsigned int i, const sofa::helper::vector< double >& m_x);

    /// @name Initial transformations application methods.
    /// @{
    /// Apply translation vector to the position.
    virtual void applyTranslation (const SReal dx, const SReal dy, const SReal dz);

    /// Rotation using Euler Angles in degree.
    virtual void applyRotation (const SReal rx, const SReal ry, const SReal rz);
    
    virtual void applyRotation (const defaulttype::Quat q);
    /// @}
    
    /// src and dest must have the same size.
    /// Performs: dest[i][j] += src[offset + i][j] 0<= i < src_entries  0<= j < 3 (for 3D objects) 0 <= j < 2 (for 2D objects)
    /// @param offset the offset in the BaseVector where the scalar values will be used. It will be updated to the first scalar value after the ones used by this operation when this method returns
    virtual void addFromBaseVectorSameSize(core::VecId dest, const defaulttype::BaseVector* src, unsigned int &offset);
}
```

## SOFA specific rules
- Tricky code should not be commented but rewritten! In general, the use of comments should be minimized by making the code self-documenting by appropriate name choices and an explicit logical structure.
- All the code under development must be tagged `SOFA_DEV`
- The use of magic numbers in the code should be avoided. Numbers other than 0 and 1 should be declared as named constants instead.
- All internal data, needed by your component, and that canâ€™t be recomputed must be put inside a `Data` or a `DataPtr`. This way, your component can be saved. Also, this `Data` will be automatically displayed inside the GUI.
- Use `sout`, `serr`, `sendl` instead of `cout`, `cerr`, `endl` in SOFA Components.
- `serr` will automatically display inside the console a message with a warning, the name of the component, and its class.  
If you modify the component in the graph, you will see a tabulation named `Warnings` with the log of all the `serr` done by the component.
- `sout` will display inside the console a message ONLY if the Data f_printLog is set to true.  
If you modify the component in the graph, you will see a tabulation named `Outputs` with the log of all the `sout` done by the component
- Use `sofa::helper::vector` and `sofa::helper::set` instead of `std::vector` and `std::set`
- Only use `sofa::simulation::tree::GNode` when you need to directly use access to the children or the parent of the node. If not, use the more generic `sofa::simulation::Node`
